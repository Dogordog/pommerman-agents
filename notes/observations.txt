Observation space
What is in the obs object passed to the agent

"""

obs is a dict() with the following keys:

alive

- A list of agents that are still alive, specified by agent_id (10, 11, 12, 13)

board

- A uint8 numpy array of shape (11, 11), with the following index

0 - passage
1 - rigid wall
2 - wood wall
3 - bomb
4 - flames
5 - fog
6 - extra bomb item
7 - extra firepower item
8 - kick
9 - skull
10 - 13: agents

- In particular, [5: fog] is only applied if the environment is partially observable, with the agent_view_size set to 4 (see pommerman.constants.AGENT_VIEW_SIZE), which means the visible area is a 9x9 square around the agent

bomb_blast_strength

- A numpy array of shape (11, 11), specifying bomb positions
- The bomb positions are specified with the blast strength (default 2 without upgrades), which is the number of tiles the blast will occupy in the four directions
- If the environment is partially observable, only bombs in view range will be shown

bomb_life

- A numpy array of shape (11, 11), specifying bomb positions
- The bomb positions are specified with the bomb's life (starts with 10 when it is planted)
- When bomb's life reaches 0, the bomb explodes

game_type

- The gametype by id

FFA = 1
Team = 2
TeamRadio = 3

game_env

- Name of the environment used eg. pommerman.env.v0:Pomme

position

- A tuple containing the x,y-coordinates of the agent

blast_strength

- An integer specifying the blast strength of the bombs planted by the agent
- Starts at 2 by default
- Can increase by 1 with every Increase Range pickup, to a maximum of 10

can_kick

- Boolean specifying whether the agent has the Can Kick ability

teammate

- Reference to the teammate
- 10 is paired with 12; 11 is paired with 13

ammo

- Integer specifying the number of bombs left
- Starts with 1 by default
- Planting a bomb reduces the ammo by 1, which is replenished when the bomb explodes
- Can be increase by 1 with every Extra Bomb pickup, no limit

enemies

- List of references to enemies
- Always of length 3 (in team games an AgentDummy is appended to make it length 3)
